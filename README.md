# Dutch
Engineered 'Dutch,' an intuitive iOS application tailored for receipt sharing. By capturing images of receipts, the app adeptly extracted crucial details such as tip, tax, subtotal, itemized descriptions, and respective costs. Integrating user-defined group members, the app distributed expenses appropriately and displayed each member's comprehensive total, encompassing their equitable contribution to tips and taxes. Developed as a solution to streamline reimbursements after seeing friends getting stuck paying the full tip and/or tax too many times, the application simplifies the process through seamless interaction. The name is inspired from the fitting expression "going Dutch". Potential features may include a history, payment integreation such as Venmo or ApplePay, multi-language support, split categories, user profiles, etc. The receipt scanning is handled by a Veryfi API.
